       "value": "Terrific place, I've known some of the staff for years and they are great people who pour their heart and soul into making each loaf. I highly recommend getting their focaccia on Fridays. They have great quality control. They are a great local business, one that makes Tucson the great city it is.\n\nIn Tucson, I could live with only 3 establishments. HF Coors, Kimchi Time, and Barrio Bread. \n\nThis place is phenomenal. A review in this case, doesn't do this place justice. I find it so wonderful that the owner and master bread maker himself mans the cash register charming and his exuberance pours into his products. I love how much history goes into the process and how small batch it really is. Get there early, grab some coffee at ombre, and wait in line, you won't be disappointed. \n\nStandouts are the Heritage Loaf (makes a great gift also), Olive Loaf, and Cinnamon Raisin bread. I'll wait any day and any time in line for Barrio Bread.\n\nDon, the owner, is the kindest person and makes amazing bread. He always has time for questions about bread, he asks about my family, is light-hearted, calm, patient, speaks kindly to his employees, and is just a good guy. The bread is delicious. Like others have said - it is worth the wait, although the line moves quickly so it's never too bad. I love his sourdough bread making video course too!\n\nAbsolutely phenomenal fresh breads that are worth the wait in line. You will not be disappointed by visiting this Tucson gem! I have honestly loved every single purchase I've made here. No worries if you aren't sure what to get, Don and his staff are always so friendly and will surely help make a recommendation if you need some advice. I highly suggest giving the Olive Fougasse a try\n\nI LOVE Barrio bread. Probably every other week after my shift I go and grab some baguettes  and a few other amazing loafs they have. Now the reason for my 2 Stars is because I find it disrespectful and disgusting of the solicitors who have their tables across Barrio Bread and think it's appropriate to just come to us while we wait in line and try to have us sign their petitions. This makes me not want to wait in line or order bread. I don't need to be harassed by an older lady to sign a paper when I say NO that means just walk away do not try to provide an explanation to me as to why I should say Yes. Hopefully the owner sees my review and can speak to those solicitors to tell them to stop. Because our purpose in waiting in line is to buy bread from you, not to get harassed to sign papers we don't want to. That's why we have human rights. 5 stars to Barrio Bread for bakery quality being excellent but I have to write 2 Stars because this is always occurring when I wait in line to purchase from Barrio Bread. I'm tired of it\n\nThe wife and I had a hankering for some Barrio Bread last Saturday, and decided to head over and grab ourselves a few loaves. \nWhat a great spot! There was a short Bread Line forming out front, but getting to enjoy the warm smell of bread...it was almost nice.\nThe owner/baker was a nice guy, chatted with us and the other customers in between working on the fresh bread going into the oven.\n\nBack at home...this bread is AMAZING! Yeah it's a buck or 2 more than at the store. But, the quality is so much better and your money STAYS LOCAL! Worth every penny.\n\nTalk about being happy to stand in a bread line!!!  I am very gluten intolerant and this quality bread is so wonderful.  The folks in the store are kind and knowledgeable.  Best bread I've ever eaten.\n\nBread is so incredibly tasty you don't need to dress it with anything! Just eat it as is!  What really amazing is the shelf life of this hand crafted bread is amazing.  I always go out of my way to pick up a loaf or two.  It's so worth it!!!\n\nLooking forward to trying all the bread.  We had pain du levain.  I should've consulted the website before heading over.\n\nGreat people, great business. I love their bread, the crust is always perfect! I hope Tucson keep this business for a long time.\n\nShowed up at 11:30 on a Friday and they were sold out of everything but baguettes.  Which was fine because it was a damn tasty baguette.  Later we found a barrio heritage loaf at a food coop on 4th ave.  That, in my opinion, was not quite as tasty.  Possibly because it was whole wheat.\n\nThere were reserved bags behind the counter at barrio, and they said there was some procedure for ordering bread several days in advance.\n\nDo not use the yelp map.  It will take you into the housing neighborhood just south of the bakery. it's across from the Falora and sushi garden.  It's pricey bread .You  will be out about 14 bucks as it's hard to leave with just one loaf.  But I can say this bread is crazy good.  Crunch, chew, earthiness, dense, and it complements  a bowl of home made minestrone soup.  If you are sourdough lovers this guy knows his stuff.  I feel sorry for gluten free people.  This bread is killer\n\nBarrio Bread has kept me sane during these Covid  months.  They have a really good system whereby the bread is listed on a board at the entrance, people line up happily with masks and depart with bags of fragrant, just-baked that day bread. And Barrio bread is so good.... The scent of baked bread accompanies you on the ride home, like a scene you wish you had had as a child.  My favorite is the birote, Don Guerra's version of a bolillo, but with a crusty that is firm, a soft interior, a combination of textures that I look forward to for breakfast with coffee and fruit.  My second favorite is the seeded whole wheat.  It has a body and crust I haven't experienced since I had freshly baked bread in Greece.  I use it with my version of Greek salads, simply dressed with a spurt of olive oil, so that the oil, juices from the ripe tomatoes and cucumbers , Kalamata olives and feta can be soaked up with this marvelous bread.  I also love the 9-grain, Cubano rolls, European rye, Khorasan and especially the Einkorn, a hearty early wheat variety that leaves you so satisfied, it should constitute one's daily bread.  My only regret is that it took me so long to write a review.  But Barrio has many fans.  If you haven't become one yet, what are you waiting for?\n\nBarrio Bread is just as good as everyone says. Seriously. \n\nBeing in Tucson for a short trip, I knew this was a place I wanted to stop. However, I had previously seen pictures and reviews mentioning there can be a long line to get to the tasty breads. I decided to go for it regardless, making it to Barrio slightly after 9am on a Friday.\n\nThere were people quickly coming and going, but no line extending down the block! Hurray! This was great as it allowed us to chat with Don, the owner and baker, and get a better idea of his background and his passion. \n\nI love that his breads are so locally sourced it's ridiculous. I love that he is very particular about his grains and knowing exactly from where they are coming. So cool. He gave us a sample of bread - fresh, still warm, and I was salivating. I made sure to ask him to see if his bread was vegan friendly - and it 100% is! He said all of his breads are (ya know, minus the cheddar jalapeno), and then it gave me the open door to grab whatever I wanted!\n\nI went with a Heritage loaf (one with the Arizona state and a Saguaro design) and one of their $1 rolls. My sister grabbed the Pan de Kino (the loaf with the arizona flag design). They were very tasty (most of it I had once I made it back home to SLC), and a lot more sour than I was expecting. But still super amazing, and it kept it's poofy softness for a long time!\n\nI was a little disappointed that they didn't have the foccia ready yet - they put it out after 11am. It just means I will need to stop by again when next in Tucson. Get all the bread here! You won't regret it!\n\nPros: a real bread shop, awesome bread, friendly service, the owner is frequently there, a wide variety of breads to choose from. \n\nCons: there is usually a line for bread (I've never waited less than 5 minutes, but on Saturday the wait can be an hour). \n\nWarning the later you go the fewer choices there may be.\n\nWow their bread is my favorite. Purchased the walnut cranberry and OMG it was so delicious. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. Just thinking about it has me planning another visit today! Excellent service also!\n\nYou might be wondering if this place is worth the hype--the short answer is YES!! We tried four different types of their bread: Cranberry Walnut, JalapeÃ±o Cheese Fougasse, Pan Epi, and Heritage Loaf. You can tell every single one of their bakes is made with genuine love and serious skill. \n\nOne downside: you'll most likely have to wait in line. We arrived around 8:50am on a Saturday morning, 10 minutes before opening. The line was already 30 people deep, and so it took until 9:30ish before we got to the cash register, where we were greeted by the owner. Don't let the line intimidate you though, you'll be glad you waited for this bread!\n\nSo grateful for Barrio Bread! \nI can never buy just one loaf. I savor every slice. \nI will gladly wait in line in 100 degree weather, during a pandemic (socially distancing with a mask of course) for Barrio bread. \n\nI haven't tried every loaf and I have no excuse, 2020 goals to try all the loaves. Pan au levain and the Heritage loaves are my favorite. \n\nThank you Barrio bread for showing us how important and incredible food can be when we support local from the bottom up.\n\nI have not had such wonderful bread since I lived in the Azores in the mid-70s!!  I always hunt for good bread, but never find the perfect one...I have now!  I did not go out to lunch as planned, and I went home and ate the cranberry and walnut bread.  I moaned while I ate it with real butter!  You must go to Barrio Bread if you love wonderful crusty, but chewy-inside bread.  It was a gastronomical treat!  (Think I liked it?).  I just saw some reviews that I wish I had written too!\n\nThe best bakery for bread in the Southwest is Barrio Bread. Don Guerra pulls together the BEST ingredients with the baking secrets of his Nana and Mother, plus a dedication for achieving customer satisfaction every time, to surprise and delight. Can't wait till my next trip to Tucson because the first stop will be Barrio Bread.\n\nBest bread in Tucson for sure. The line can be long on weekend mornings, but that's only a testament to their quality bread. They keep the line moving quickly and do so with a smile. I'd give it six stars if I could.\n\nThe bread is amazing.  The first time I took a bite of their bread it took me back to when I visited France. When I got back to the u.s I could not find a bakery that could come close to the bakeries in France, until someone told me about Barrio Bread. Omg this place is amazing thank you for existingIf I could give it 10 stars I would.\n\nMost reviewers have nailed the ethos of barrio bread. A high quality product using speciality local grains that people will be happy to line up for. I came here for the first time on a Friday. Arrived at opening ( 9 am) parking without issue. Line was already 30 minutes plus. While they still had plenty of offerings some things were already running low (or out) by 9:30 am. The bread was fresh and amazing! Sliced up some loafs and gave to neighbors so they could try it as well. Unfortunately for me it's 45 - 50 minute drive from my place. Next time I'll wake up earlier and get there a good 20 minutes before opening. So I can be sure to get everything offered. This place is an easy 5 star Yelp establishment. Just come early :-) and be aware that offerings vary daily - so good to check on what's available before coming.\n\nSaw good things about Barrio Bread, so we thought we'd check it out on a Thursday afternoon. Drove 1/2 hour and got there about at 3:30. They were closed, even though the sign on the door says they are open until 5:00. Very disappointing.\n\nThe bread is awesome. A lot of the time, a big chunk doesn't survive the drive home - no butter or anything. And the owner, Don, is super cool. The dude knows a lot about bread. The Jalapeno Cheddar is the best. I have not convinced Don to make it on a daily basis yet.\n\nBest bread in Tucson, maybe in Arizona! I buy at least 3 loafs...eat one, freeze one and gift one to a neighbour or friend. \n\nI wish they'd open more stores, but seeing that the owner paid big bucks for a very expensive Italian oven, I guess I'll have to do for this one store.\n\nI absolutely love Barrio breads! I stood in line for an hour before they opened just to make sure that I got the bread that I wanted. It was so worth it. The chocolate cherry bread and the sourdough Kino bread was my favorite. Can't wait to try it again when I'm back in Tucson. The best bread I've ever had anywhere in the world.\n\nIf you want great tasting fresh bread this is the place!!!!\n\nEverything everybody else says is true: get here early for your bread. There was a line out the door this Saturday morning and the Epi bread without seeds was sold out. No problem, I'll take that Epi bread with the seeds...and a couple of Cuban rolls, and a loaf of cranberry walnut bread. All told $15.50. Truly great bread and the Barrio Bread folks are very kind and happy. I feel so fortunate to have found Barrio Bread! Shout out to Food Conspiracy Co-op where I first came across this artisan bread.\n\nOkay I Love Bread! Especially Bario Bread.  There is a line quite often out the door of Bario Bread and it's worth the wait, I did the line twice actually yesterday it is that worth it!  There isn't a loaf I don't like! Yesterday after sampling the Polish Emmer Rye Bread and taking a slice to my husband sitting in the car with a hip replacement.  He said \"If the line isn't bad please go back and buy this, I love it.\"  Well I didn't even pay attention to the line and stood again, this time enjoying a birote from my earlier purchase.  While waiting, a text came through from my husband, \"Get 2\". We cannot get enough of Don's delicious bread and the wholesome energy with in his bakery.  It is a Tucson Favorite errand/adventure for us\n\nMy go to place for healthy, delicious, real bread! It's so good I buy lots of loaves and freeze them for later or to give as gifts.\n\nHands down best bakery in town. Every time we've come there's always a line down the block. Come early! You can smell the fresh baked, warm bread that makes your mouth drool. You can tell the owner is so passionate about everything from the ingredients to the designs on the loaves to the freshness and to his customers! The available bread he has changes based on day of the week and some loaves are only available at a certain time too so I would check that out! When we came we got 3 loaves: the seeded whole wheat, the heritage, and the cinnamon raisin. They were all HEAVENLY! Best part is, you can freeze the bread and pop it in the toaster, and it tastes just as good! We love you Barrio Bread! Please open an east side location!!\n\n***Worth the wait*** \nA must if you're a local or a visitor\n\nstopped in on Saturday to grab some bread for the week! I had eaten Barrio bread at many of the local restaurants and fell in love with it. Parking was a little limited, but finally found a spot in front of Bieber breakfast club. The line was from the front door of barrio bread and looped around the parking lot just south of Broadway. Line seemed to be running fast so I waited. Took about 1/2 hr to get to the front of the line. As I waited I made sure to look up the website so I could be ready to order what I wanted. \n\nWhile I waited every patron was practicing social distancing and wearing mask. That made me happy and made me feel comfortable waiting on that line. \n\nOnce I approached the shop there was a daily menu on the window with prices and what was available. That made it convenient and easier to know what was left or sold out.  I got to the window and the owner/baker himself was serving the customers (Don Guerra). I went with a baguette, focaccia, Pain epi, and a jalapeÃ±o cheddar loaf.  It all was fresh and warm! Took me back to when my nana would bake her bread in a wood oven growing up. \n\nMade it home and cut up slices for a charcuterie board and some sandwiches with the jalapeÃ±o loaf. \nAll was fantastic and flavorful. It was definitely worth the wait and will continue to purchase my bread from this place!\n\nBe sure to call ahead and place an order.  Showed up at noon and all the bread was gone and they were closed. Nice folks\nRead about them in The NY Times and went clear across town with no joy\n\nThe best bread in Tucson. I have nothing but great things to saw about Barrio! Every item I have ever gotten has been absolutely amazing. Everything is so fresh and you can tell everyone here loves what they do, plus they're all so kind. Definitely a staple in Tucson!\n\nBarrio Bread is SO WONDERFUL. Don sells fantastic artisan bread that is truly a work of art (really cool cacti stencils on the loaves) in addition to flour, grains, and has free sourdough starter you can pick up. The line gets long on weekends and can wrap around the building but it's worth the wait! I like baking my own loaves using his flour and starter as well as picking up a Heritage Loaf (pictured here) to snack on during the drive home! He also sells online bread classes with instructional videos and has a free sourdough pizza crust lesson. Don is such an asset to the community, he's always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable!\n\nIncredible bakery, must get there early, fresh smell of baked bread is intoxicating.. specials are different everyday..  \n.\n\nDue to construction coming back from an errand I had to run I got lost. Well sort of. I really think I got found. \n\nI was driving by and saw a small line at a door. Looked up and it said Barrio Bread. I was intrigued. How did I not know this place was here?\n\nI pulled over and went to stand in line. There was a sandwich board with a selection of fresh baked breads and kits to make your own bread at home. \n\nAlways diving in to get a good taste of what a place has to offer I decided to get the jalapeno cheddar cheese, the chocolate bread and the cranberry walnut. \n\nI also purchased the pizza flour blend. \n\nWhat beautiful loaves of bread. Just beautiful. Soft, fresh with a beautiful crumb. This bread has texture and is so full of flavor. \n\nI've have had  jalapeno cheese before where you couldn't taste either ingredient   I can smell the jalapeÃ±o ever so mildly. I can see and taste both ingredients perfectly. Not spicy just flavored.  \n\nThe cranberry walnut is cranberry with a little nuttiness. Also very flavorful. A touch of butter or your favorite spread and it's over the top. \n\nThe chocolate bread is delectable. Full of semisweet chocolate this bread could be dessert. Yummm! \n\nHaven't tried making my own pizza dough but I have no doubt it'll be wonderful\n\nOh and did I mention, it's also organic with no preservatives. \n\nI will definitely go back. I will take my out of town guests here. Im not even a bread person. But having found this place I might just become one.\n\nI love everything this place is about. It always smells amazing, the bread is great, doesn't matter how much I ate I still want more\n#ThankYouThursday\n\nFew lines are worth waiting in, but the line at Barrio Bread is absolutely worthwhile, so be sure to stop here early in the AM, when visiting Tuscon.\n\nThe first day we tried to come here two hours before closing, and they were already completely sold out for the day.  The next day we arrived in the am to a line out 30 people deep, that moved fairly quickly, but expect to spend about 20-30 minutes minimum waiting for bread.\n\nIs it worth it?  It is.  We got several loaves: their fruit loaf, a multigrain heritage loaf, some olive oil and salt focaccia and my absolute favorite a small sized chewy Cuban roll warm from the oven and covered in sesame seeds.  The sesame Cuban roll was so delicious, it reminded me of my favorite Montreal bagel at St. Viateur's, perfectly fresh, warm from the oven and chewy.\n\nThis is likely the best bread you'll ever find or eat in Arizona, if not in fact the best bread west of the Mississippi.  The best part is the use and reliance on regional, heritage wheats and grains, grown on local farms (\"15 miles away\") and ground by a local mill, using slow-rising, sour-dough type yeasts.  Highly recommended.  But if you go, go early, 'cause once he sells out, he closes the shop.\n\nMy secret to finding good food often starts by just seeing how long the line at the restaurant.  Barrio Bread take this to a new level, with locals lining up almost an hour early on a Saturday morning to be able to pick up this bread.  And regardless of how long you wait, it is still worth it! Even if you don't get the bread you originally wanted because you just can't go wrong with whatever you order.  \n\nI have been multiple times and have enjoyed whatever I have picked up.  These breads make a fantastic pickup for any dinner and will impress as a gift to others.  My personal favorites are the Cinnamon Raisin and the Heritage loaves.  I've probably bought 10 different loaves of bread from them and have never been disappointed.  \n\nA MUST visit while in Tucson.  Nothing beats the locally made bread."
